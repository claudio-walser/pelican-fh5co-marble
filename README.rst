Example blog
------------

You can find a fully working example under https://github.com/claudio-walser/pelican-fh5co-marble-example

.. code:: console

    git clone https://github.com/claudio-walser/pelican-fh5co-marble.git
    git clone https://github.com/claudio-walser/pelican-fh5co-marble-example.git
    cd pelican-fh5co-marble-example
    pelican
    ./develop_server.sh start 8081

Then visit http://localhost:8081 with your browser.



Contact Form
------------

To get the contact form working, you need to change SMTP Login values in output/theme/mail-config.php
For security reasons, NEVER check in this file anywhere but replace values in the output folder of your Pelican Blog manually or by script.
Personally I build my pelican sites using jenkins and there i have a build step which is replacing SMTP Login values after the pelican build.

.. code:: php

    <?php

    define('SMTP_SERVER', 'mail.your-domain.com');
    define('SMTP_PORT', 587); # usually, only smtp over tls is supported
    define('SMTP_REALNAME', 'John Doe');
    define('SMTP_USER', 'john.doe@your-domain.com');
    define('SMTP_PASS', 'secret');

    define('RECIPIENT', 'john.doe@your-domain.com');
    define('RECIPIENT_REALNAME', 'John Doe');

    ?>

To create a new language, execute translations.sh

Then translate the strings in ./locale/ru_RU/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po

Again, thanks to Alexandre Vicenzi because I copied his script.
